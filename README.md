# Description
Hello There! We got tired of not having good axure widgets to design apps with. There are tons of quality PSDs and Sketch resources out there but just a lack of free axure resources. So we made our own, and guess what? We like to share.

<br>

# How to use it?
1. You should install Roboto since it's the main Android font or Helvetica for iOS. 
2. Download the Axure library file: 
	- [UXTOOLTIME Android Material Design for Axure](https://github.com/iamkeeler/UXTOOLTIME/raw/master/UXTT-Android-Material-Design-V01.rplib "Just download it already ;)")
	- [UXTOOLTIME iOS 8 for Axure](https://github.com/iamkeeler/UXTOOLTIME/raw/master/UXTT-iOS8-V1-1.rplib "Just download it already ;)")
3. Open Axure, click the three bars icon and choose "Load Library". Find the library file to Load it.
4. Profit!!!

*Alpha Versions of the libraries are available but either have missing controls or spotty functionality. Download and use at your own risk!*
